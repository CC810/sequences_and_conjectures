Functions to determine number sequences or conjectures

Finding the end of a numerical serie is a bit of a game (at leat for me). So I thought that programming with Python the function to determine those sequences of numbers, could help me to pratice my python and have fun. 
I use this opportunity to redesign those function to be more pythonic or more efficient when I learn a new way of programming things (more pythonic for instance). 
The jupyter notebook "playing_with_numbers" is there to apply those functions but also test different things like the running time for instance. 
To conclude, the jupyter notebook is my playground and the python files are my toys.

**- Collatz conjecture:**
whatever is your starting number (as to be >=1 and an interger), you will arrive to 1. No practical application, just for the fun of coding it.

**- Fibonacci number:**
You can hear more often about this sequence. Multiple applications (even some biological events follow this pattern)
