Functions to determine number sequences or conjectures

Finding the end of a numerical serie is a bit of a game (at least for me). So I thought that programming with Python the function to determine those sequences of numbers, could help me to pratice my python and have fun. 
I use this opportunity to redesign those functions to be more pythonic or more efficient when I learn something new.

The jupyter notebook "playing_with_numbers" is there to apply those functions but also test different things like the running time for instance. 
To conclude, the jupyter notebook is my playground and the python files are my toys.

**- Collatz conjecture:**
whatever is your starting number (as to be >=1 and an interger), you will arrive to 1. No practical application, just for the fun of coding it.

**- Fibonacci number:**
You can hear more often about this sequence. Multiple applications (even some biological events follow this pattern)

**- Mandelbrot and Julia sets:**
Those iterations are present in the jupyter notebook "mandelbrot.ipynb". In the notebook, you will find my notes (where to find more info...), the code and - most importantly - how to draw the iterations giving those beautiful pattern... **mathematics is art**
